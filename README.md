# TRAA - Thames River Anglers Association!

These TRAA people are for the enhancement, protection and promotion of a viable, multi-species fishery within the Thames River watershed.
This website is to recreate their original website that was designed by someone that apparently "learned how to code a website for low budget". We applied our design to their original contents also to show our ability of doing css animations, transitions and coping javascript. Midterm version is only a overall concept for the new design.

## Installation

Please go to this [GitHub](https://github.com/luisavm/Tsao_Valero_Midterm) and download the folder to your computer. Inside the folder there would be " index.html " for you to go to the webpages.
